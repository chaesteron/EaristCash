An e-wallet, also known as a digital wallet or mobile wallet, is a digital application that allows users to store, manage, and transact funds electronically. It serves as a virtual container for various payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, bank account information, and even cryptocurrencies. E-wallets have gained popularity due to their convenience, security, and ease of use in making payments and financial transactions.
